Planned archetypes to specifically support through abilities/techs/items:

L - Luck - focus on the Luck stat and abilities/techs/items that have a rng-based triggered effect
R - Recoil/Take damage - focus on taking damage intentionally and using things that profit off of that
W - Wall - focus on maintaining health and slowly whittling down enemies with damage over time effects
T - Techs - focus on strong, synergistic techs and optimizing them
O - One-hit - focus on stacking buffs and using powerful techs to deal a ton of damage in one shot
G - Generic - abilities that aren't really specific to an archetype, just value.
